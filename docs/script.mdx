# Scripting

The choosing language for Neptune, is Lua.

This isn't a tutorial of how to write in Lua, it's how it's like in Neptune structured.

## Script Creation
<DeprecatedBadge customMessage="Currently not added. Subject to change!">
</DeprecatedBadge>

When you create a script the basic setup for it will be like this

```lua
-- script_name

--[[

When the game start this function automaticly runs, here you will be able to run setup stuff,
like EventListener, sprite creation, keybinds, and many more..

--]]
local M = {}

function M.init()
    print("Hello world!")
end

--[[

This is the code that gets called every frame to be runned
This **should** help prevent the usage of using while true loops

--]]

function M.update()
    print("update called!")
end

-- Don't call the init or update function, it will be ignored!

```

## Base functions
With the engine, we give you some cool functions, which we are going to explain now!

### halt
```cpp
halt(numSec : number) -> void
```

Halts the script for the given number of seconds

Example:
```lua
print("Hello world!")
halt(3)
print("Hello again!")
```
